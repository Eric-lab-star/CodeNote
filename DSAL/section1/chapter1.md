# Data Structure and Algorithms

## Classification of data Structure and Structural design patterns

- Linear
  lists/ sets/ tuples/ queues/ stacks/ heap
- Non-Linera
  Trees/ tables/ containers
- Homogenous
  2d arrays/ MultiDArray
- Heterogenous
  Linked Lists/ Ordered Lists/ Unordered Lists
- Dynamic
  Dictionaries/ TreeSets/ Sequences

## List, Tuples and Heaps

### Lists

    A lists is sequence of elements.
    Each element can be connected to another with a link.
    List have a variable length and developer can remove or add elements more easily

### Tuples

Tuples are typically immutable sequential collections.
